"""
Shared DuckDB helpers for parquet-backed readers.

Every reader that queries a large parquet file should go through here rather
than loading the file into pandas. The win is predicate pushdown: DuckDB reads
only the row groups whose statistics can satisfy the WHERE clause, so a viewport
query touches a fraction of the file instead of all of it.

The alternative — ``pq.read_table(path).to_pandas()`` followed by a pandas mask —
reads and materializes every row on every request, which is what made transcript
and boundary panning slow on full-size datasets.

    index quietly stops paying for itself.

    Inlining is safe here because these are numbers, never user-controlled text:
    every value is passed through ``float()``, so nothing but a finite numeric

    The kept count is ``n`` in expectation rather than exactly — within a
    fraction of a percent at transcript scale. ``total`` should be the
    pre-sample count the caller already has. ``key_cols`` should identify a row:
    a unique id column where the format has one, otherwise coordinates plus
    gene. Rows sharing a key share a verdict, which is harmless at that grain.
